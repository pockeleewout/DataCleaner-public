A database cleaning utility

## Contributing (Developers)
### New features
Create a new branch for __any features separately__. The branch should only be merged when the feature is approved.

If you need another feature, the __used feature(s)__ should be merged __first__. If you need multiple features to develop 
yours, merge all the other features to your branch and wait for all of them to be merged to the master branch.

To merge a branch to the master branch, create a __pull request__. The general rule should be to ask __review__ of other 
developers.

### Bug fixes
Bugs should be entered in the **bug tracker** (especially if you do not intend to fix them). You should also regularly 
check it for bugs in your code and assign those to yourselves, or someone that is working on them.

Generally, the same rules as those of new features apply

If it's a hotfix (really urgent), exceptions can be made.

### Reviewing pull requests
When asked to review a pull request, checkout the branch locally, run the tests and use the app shortly to find bugs.
If you do not feel comfortable reviewing a pull request, ask help from another developer.
